## Abstract

This white paper proposes a novel approach called CATCH (Contextual Association Through Conversational Hypervectors), improved with the LVC (Linked Vector Context) method, to address the issues with how current AI systems handle context. The approach involves condensing lengthy conversations or text into a language code that acts as a "container" for the important elements of the conversation or text. These containers are stored in a database that excels in remembering the context of a conversation, effectively managing voluminous text while preserving the underlying meaning.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**\
Current solutions for maintaining context in conversational AI models face several challenges. The CATCH Approach with the LVC method addresses these limitations while offering computational efficiency and maintaining strong privacy norms.

2. **The CATCH Approach**\
The CATCH Approach involves transforming significant parts of a conversation or long text sequences into high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings are stored in an associative (vector) database, enabling the AI model to access contextually relevant parts of the conversation based on semantic similarity.

3. **The LVC (Linked Vector Context) Method**\
The LVC method suggests managing context more effectively by storing conversations in a vector database and retrieving relevant segments when needed. This method considers a larger span of conversation history without having to process the entire conversation each time, offering computational efficiency and better preservation of user privacy.

4. **Efficiency and Privacy in the CATCH Approach**\
The CATCH Approach with LVC enhancement is computationally efficient and committed to privacy. It utilizes the rapid processing capabilities and scalability of modern vector databases and stores conversation fragments as vector embeddings rather than raw text.
